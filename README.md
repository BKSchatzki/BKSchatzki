# Me - Software Engineer

- I break things until they work
- I overengineer stuff until stuff is simple

## Stuff I do

- I make tools to make life easier for my nerd friends.[^1]
- I present these tools at local meetups to my nerd friends.[^2]
- Sometimes I wake up and find myself leading software development lifecycles.
  1. In these situations, I inevitably have opinions about the existing codebase.
  2. I volunteer to fix everything myself by changing the whole stack.
  3. ???
  4. I learn the value of teamwork. That counts as profit.[^3]
  5. Rinse and repeat.
- Senior year of university, I stumbled into working with an [AlphaLab](https://www.alphalab.org/)-funded startup.
  - Actually, I just did the music for their app.
  - I have an undertapped network.

## Stuff I use

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, React, SQL, MongoDB, TypeScript, Git & Version Control, REST API, GraphQL, Next.js, Prisma, Mongoose, Jest, Jira, Figma, Bootstrap, Material UI, Tailwind CSS, OOP, Agile, Accessibility, Docker, Cloud Platforms, and other stuff too.

## Connecting...stuff

Find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/bkschatzki), reply to me on [X](https://x.com/bkschatzki), or check out a slightly nicer version of this bio on [my personal site](https://bkschatzki.dev).

[^1]: By nerd friends, I mean tabletop roleplaying nerds and music theory nerds who don't rate pop music because it's too diatonic.
[^2]: This time, the term "nerd friends" refers to fellow tech people. As you can see, I am excellent at naming things and never create ambiguity in the codebase.
[^3]: See [Underpants Gnomes](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomes_(South_Park)>).
[^4]: The word cloud for this bio is just the word STUFF.
